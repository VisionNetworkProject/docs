$VNET Token and plan of distribution
====================================



Use it, invest it, not hype it
------------------------------

This is also our **blockchain technology application** value philosophy.

We are building an increasingly mature system, in which VNET Token will be the only measure of value and means of payment in such a sustainable and healthy environment. It is clear that the basic design of 1 VNET = 100GB after ecological maturity will ensure that the price of VNET is not destined to deviate too much from the anchoring of its actual use value. We expect users with real demands to buy VNET through exchanges or other channels and use it for appropriate network services. Of course, the value logic of VNET is so clear that proper investment is also a good choice.


Total 35 billion, absolute majority amount will be handed over to the users
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The team and the early investors held only 22% of the total, in which the project team held 12% total using an open smart contract address and locked all balance for 3 years, while the balance of the early investors is locked up by 80%.

78% of VNET will ultimately be held by users, with 53.11% of sales being the largest share, while the remaining 18.89% will be used for community rewards, and 5% for application development support plan.
