   |

   Enter an address and press `Query`,
   4 values will be returned, let's focus the first two ones.

   whitelisted
      If it returns ``true``, means the address is already whitelisted, otherwise, no.

   whitelistReferralsCount
      The quantity of whitelisted referrals, from the given address.


Where could I buy some Voken2.0?
   There may be these ways:

   - Participate in :ref:`voken2_sale`, send ETH to buy.
   - Follow :ref:`get_1001voken2`.
   - Ask your friend to send you some.


After my address was whitelisted, what will happen if I send 1,001.0 Voken2.0 to my friend or others?
   Just like normal transfer,
   whitelist registration couldn't be trigger twice.
