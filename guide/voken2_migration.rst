Additional benefits of completing the migration
-----------------------------------------------

Once your Voken is migrated to Voken2.0,
you will automatically become a Voken **SHAREHOLDER**,
have a 30% annual interest rate,
and enjoy the #6-20 season sales dividend according to the shareholding ratio.

See :ref:`voken2_shareholders_program` for more details.

There are 3 statistic timestamps below,
and all the holders who complete the migration will jointly allocate a part of ETH
as an **additional reward** according to the proportion in :ref:`voken2_shareholders_program`.

Precautions
-----------

All **Voken** should be migrated to **Voken2.0**, and the deadline is **2019-09-07 23:59:59 UTC**.

After that time, the transfer function of the original contract will stop.
Voken that has not completed the migration will be considered as no-own, and no longer valid.

The project team and early angel investors had no sales dividends.
