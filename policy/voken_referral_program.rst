Whitelist Registration Referral Reward: 100%
--------------------------------------------

- Anyone who participate in the :ref:`voken2_sale`
  by using a whitelisted ETH wallet address
  would enjoy a gift of **BUY ONE AND GET ONE MORE FREE**.
- Sign-up each whitelist wallet address needs ``1,001 Voken2.0``,
  and a referrer's wallet address is needed
  which is already whitelisted.
- The **whitelist referral relationship chain** data will be saved
  to :ref:`voken2_main_contract` on the Ethereum blockchain,
  which cannot be tampered.
- ``1,000 Voken2.0`` will be **used as rewards**,
  and ``1 Voken2.0`` will be returned as a success signal.
- Settled with Voken2.0,
  will transfer to your wallet addresses automatically and immediately,
  process by contract.
- Get one more level for each registration with your whitelisted address,
  ``300 Voken2.0`` for direct referral reward (Lv.1, default),
  up to 15 levels (15+ referrals):
