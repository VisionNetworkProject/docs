Whitelist Registration Referral Reward: 100%
--------------------------------------------

- Anyone who participate in the :ref:`voken2_sale`
  by using a whitelisted ETH wallet address
  would enjoy a gift of **BUY ONE AND GET ONE MORE FREE**.
- Sign-up each whitelist wallet address needs ``1,001 Voken2.0``,
  and a referrer's wallet address is needed
  which is already whitelisted.
- The **whitelist referral relationship chain** data will be saved
  to :ref:`voken2_main_contract` on the Ethereum blockchain,
  which cannot be tampered.
- ``1,000 Voken2.0`` will be **used as rewards**,
  and ``1 Voken2.0`` will be returned as a success signal.
- Settled with Voken2.0,
  will transfer to your wallet addresses automatically and immediately,
  process by contract.
- Get one more level for each registration with your whitelisted address,
  ``300 Voken2.0`` for direct referral reward (Lv.1, default),
  up to 15 levels (15+ referrals):

=========  =====  =============================
Referrals  Level  Reward (1,000 Voken2.0 Total)
=========  =====  =============================
>= 1       Lv.1   **300 Voken2.0**
>= 2       Lv.2   200 Voken2.0
>= 3       Lv.3   100 Voken2.0
>= 4       Lv.4   100 Voken2.0

>= 14      Lv.14  10 Voken2.0
>= 15      Lv.15  10 Voken2.0
=========  =====  =============================

- When the contract automatically settles the 1,000 Voken2.0 reward,
  some Lvs may be absent (due to insufficient referrals, or do not exist).
  In this case, all unsuccessful rewards will be destroyed forever.
