Voken 2.0 migration guide
=========================

All Voken holders should follow this instruction to finish the migration in a month.
Convert your Voken to **Voken2.0**.



Only 1 step
-----------

You will receive
----------------

You will receive **Voken2.0** in 48 hours.



Additional benefits of completing the migration
-----------------------------------------------

After Voken is migrated to Voken2.0,
you will automatically become a VOKEN **SHAREHOLDER**,
have a 30% annual interest rate,
and enjoy the #7-20 season sales dividend according to the shareholding ratio.

See :ref:`voken_shareholders_program` for more details.

Every one week is a statistical period,
and all the holders who complete the migration will jointly allocate a part of ETH
as an additional reward according to the proportion in :ref:`voken_shareholders_program`.

Precautions
-----------

All **Voken** should be migrated to **Voken2.0**, and the deadline is **2019-09-30 23:59:59 +UTC**.

After that time, the transfer function of the original contract will stop.
Voken that has not completed the migration will be considered as no-own, and no longer valid.

The project team and early angel investors had no sales dividends.
