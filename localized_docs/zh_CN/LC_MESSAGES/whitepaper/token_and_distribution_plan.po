"We are building an increasingly mature system, in which VNET Token will be "
"the only measure of value and means of payment in such a sustainable and "

" to deviate too much from the anchoring of its actual use value. We expect "
"users with real demands to buy VNET through exchanges or other channels and "
"use it for appropriate network services. Of course, the value logic of VNET "
"is so clear that proper investment is also a good choice."
