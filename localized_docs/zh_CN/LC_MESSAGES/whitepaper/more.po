"Tor, The Onion Router, is an open source, free software for anonymous "
"communications. The project was initially sponsored by the Naval Research "
"Laboratory. It can help users communicate and browse. Tor anonymously on the"
" Internet through the way of Entry node, Middle node and Exit Node multi-"

"Obviously, the design of vnVPN has naturally satisfied the technical "
"foundation for preventing tracking, anonymous browsing and communication. If"
" VISION goes one step further and implements a multi-proxy application "
"vnTOR, vnTOR has obvious advantages over the original Tor network. In other "
"words, an ecosystem that uses VNET Token can motivate the participation of "
"nodes (more service nodes participate, not just use and claimants), and "
"network quality and service quality are more stable and more efficient."

"Obviously, Tor has great value and reference value for the exploration and "
"implementation of the network's anonymity and neutrality, and we believe "
"that the crux of the problem that currently leads to the slow and unsuitable"
" use of the Tor network lies in the no incentives. Most of the users who "
"participate in Tor are requesters. They are online when they use it, and "
"they don't keep running when they are not used. As a result, the number of "
"service nodes is in the state of shortage of demand for a long time."

"According to the actual development of the Vision Network project and "
"opinions of the community, we may develop and implement the vnTOR multi-"
"proxy function in the later period (the user selects the number of proxy "
"layers and pays the corresponding VNET to drive two or more nodes to "
"participate in the routing of data packets. The user can know the node_id of"
" the service node on the path, and the service node is only responsible for "
"completing the data packet routing between the adjacent nodes. The user's "
"source IP is invisible to both the intermediate node and the target "
"website.). It can even be connected to Tor. The network is open, allowing "
"users to visit the address with an .onion suffix, even you can use Hidden "
"Wiki and the Torch search engine."
