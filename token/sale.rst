$VNET TokenSale (About to start)
================================

:ref:`vnet_token` has accurate service value and usage value anchoring.
You can spend 1 VNET to exchange 100GB traffic to use the Internet without obstacles,
or earn VNET by selling/sharing your idle bandwidth.

We introduced whitelist and referral mechanisms
in the TokenSale rules.
There is an exciting plan that everyone
who has an Ethereum wallet address can participate in.

For a huge, unmet, just-needed market,
this is a win-win solution for the whole system.
The sooner you participate in the purchase,
the more you will enjoy the benefits of ecological growth.
If you are willing to participate in community promotion,
popularize consensus, and expand your users,
you will receive additional rewards.


Service Value & Usage Value ANCHORING
-------------------------------------

- **1 VNET = 100GB** client traffic, solid usage value
- 100GB is worth about **$8.0 ~ $8.5** in mature IDCs and cloud service platforms,
  such as AWS and GCP


Incremental sales price: $0.001 ~ $0.601 USD
--------------------------------------------

Starting at **1 VNET = $0.001 USD**, until the price rises to **1 VNET = $0.601**

Total sales are divided into 60,000 stages, each step of $0.00001 USD.

In the very first phase, named **RAPID-GROWTH/LIMITED-SALES PHASE**,
which is divided into 15,000 stages,
each selling 100,000 VNET, for a total of 1.5 billion VNET.

Whenever a stage is finished, the exchange price increases by $0.00001 USD:

+--------------+--------------+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| Stage Number | Sales Volume | Exchange Price | Sales Amount                      |
+==============+==============+================+===================================+
| 0            | 100,000 VNET | $0.00100       | $100 + $0 = **$100 USD**          |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1            | 100,000 VNET | $0.00101       | $100 + $1 = **$101 USD**          |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 2            | 100,000 VNET | $0.00102       | $100 + $2 = **$102 USD**          |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| ...          | 100,000 VNET | ...            | ...                               |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+-----------------------------------+
| 15000        | 100,000 VNET | $0.15100       | $100 + $15,100 = **$15,100 USD**  |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+-----------------------------------+

After rapid-growth/limited-sales phase finished,
**STEADY-GROWTH PHASE** automatically comes (45,000 stages total),
$15,100 USD for each stage,
until the exchange price reaches 1 VNET = $0.601 USD:

+--------------+-------------------+----------------+-----------------+
| Stage Number | Sales Volume      | Exchange Price | Sales Amount    |
+==============+===================+================+=================+
| 15001        | 99993.377922 VNET | $0.15101       | **$15100 USD**  |
+--------------+-------------------+----------------+-----------------+
| 15002        | 99986.756721 VNET | $0.15102       | **$15100 USD**  |

Ethereum Contract: 7.172 billion VNET for Sale
----------------------------------------------

There is **7.172 billion VNET** would released
accounting for **20.49%** of the total supply.

All VNET tokens for sale would be stored in an open-sourced Ethereum contract,

Crypto-currency ETH will be used as the only trading medium to complete the sale.


Dynamic Audit ETH price
