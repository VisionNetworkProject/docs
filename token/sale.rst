$VNET TokenSale (About to start)
================================

:ref:`vnet_token` has accurate service value and usage value anchoring.
You can spend 1 VNET to exchange 100GB traffic to use the Internet without obstacles,
or earn VNET by selling/sharing your idle bandwidth.

We introduced whitelist and referral mechanisms
in the TokenSale rules.
There is an exciting plan that everyone
who has an Ethereum wallet address can participate in.

For a huge, unmet, just-needed market,
this is a win-win solution for the whole system.
The sooner you participate in the purchase,
the more you will enjoy the benefits of ecological growth.
If you are willing to participate in community promotion,
popularize consensus, and expand your users,
you will receive additional rewards.


Ethereum Contract: 7.172 billion VNET for Sale
----------------------------------------------

There is **7.172 billion VNET** would released
accounting for **20.49%** of the total supply.

All VNET tokens for sale would be stored in an open-sourced Ethereum contract,
to make sure it is clear and free to check anytime.
Crypto-currency ETH will be used as the only trading medium to complete the sale.


Dynamic Audit ETH price
-----------------------

Using ETH as the payment medium,
we will adjust the **Audit ETH price**
according to the latest price in the trading market to ensure
that VNET is relatively stable against legal tender
at different times during the pre-sale phase.

.. NOTE::

   **Latest Audit ETH price: $150**

   That means you can use 1 ETH as $150 USD.



Referral reward: **50% - 100%**
