Incremental sales price: $0.001 - $0.601

Starting at **1 Voken = $0.001**, until the price reaches **$0.601**.

Total sales are divided into 60,000 stages, each step of $0.00001.

In the very first phase, named **RAPID-GROWTH PHASE**,
which is divided into 15,000 stages,
each selling 100,000 Vokens, for a total of 1.5 billion Vokens.

Whenever a stage is finished, the exchange price increases by $0.00001:

+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------------------+
| Stage Number | Sales Volume   | Exchange Price | Sales Amount                 |
+==============+================+================+==============================+
| 0            | 100,000 Vokens | **$0.00100**   | $100 + $0 = **$100**         |
+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------------------+
| 1            | 100,000 Vokens | $0.00101       | $100 + $1 = **$101**         |
+--------------+----------------+----------------+------------------------------+
| 2            | 100,000 Vokens | $0.00102       | $100 + $2 = **$102**         |

Dynamic Audit ETH price

Using ETH as the payment medium,
we will adjust the **Audit ETH price** dynamically,
according to the latest price in the trading market,
in order to ensure that Voken is relatively stable against legal tender
at different times during the whole sale phase.

**Latest Audit ETH price: $170**, That means you can use 1 ETH as $170 USD.


Per transaction
---------------

- Minimum: 0.1 ETH
- Maximum: 100 ETH


Bonus
-----

A single transaction ``> 10 ETH`` will receive **10% bonus**.

For example
-----------

If you send **20 ETH** to the :ref:`voken_sale_contract`
at the **37500th stage**,
and the **Audit ETH price** goes to **$200 USD** for example:

- This **20 ETH** will be treated as `$200 x20 ETH =` **$4,000 USD**.
- At the **37500th stage**,
  the exchange price is **$0.37600**,
  that is `$4000 / $0.37600 =` **10638.297872 Vokens**.
- A single transaction ``> 10 ETH`` will receive **10% bonus**,
  that is `10638.297872 x 10% =` **1063.829787 Vokens**.
- Subtotal: `10638.297872 + 1063.829787 =` **11702.667659 Vokens**.
- If your address is whitelisted,
  according to **BUY ONE AND GET ONE MORE FREE** privilege,
  you will receive a gift of **11702.667659 Vokens**.

Finally, the amount is `11702.667659 + 11702.667659 =` **23405.335318 Vokens**.
